# PDF.js Express - Angular sample

[PDF.js Express](https://pdfjs.express/) is a powerful JavaScript-based PDF Library that leverages PDF.js and adds additional features such as annotations, form support, and digitial signatures. It provides a slick out-of-the-box responsive UI that interacts with the core library to view, annotate and manipulate PDFs that can be embedded into any web project.
